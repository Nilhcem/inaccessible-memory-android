## What is it?

`Inaccessible memory` is a [Concentration][3] game *only playable* by people having Google Talkback running on their device. (it should also work pretty well with BrailleBack).

The goal is to frustrate 'sighted players' the same way apps designed without accessibility in mind frustrate non-sighted users.
